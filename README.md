# 🚢 Titanic Survival – Descriptive Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores the Titanic dataset using **descriptive statistical methods** to identify survival patterns.  
The objective is to analyze both categorical and numerical features to uncover insights using tools like **Python**, **Jupyter Notebook**, and **Power BI**.

---

## 📊 Data Overview

- **Source:** Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)  
- **Records:** 891 passengers  
- **Features:** Sex, Age, Fare, Pclass, Embarked, etc.  
- **Target Column:** `Survived` (1 = Survived, 0 = Not Survived)

## 🔍 Summarised Key Insights

- Females had a **74% survival rate**, while males had **19%**
- 1st class passengers had a **63%** survival rate; 3rd class had **24%**
- Passengers from **Cherbourg (C)** had the highest survival rate (**55%**)
- **Fare** was highly skewed with outliers; **Age** was more normally distributed after imputation
- **Parch** was excluded from outlier analysis due to minimal variance

---

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

- Handling missing data in `Age` and `Embarked` columns
- Identifying meaningful insights from skewed numerical data
- Managing layout complexity while designing the Power BI dashboard
- Balancing clarity and detail in the written report

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** – Data analysis & transformation  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Step-by-step development  
- **Power BI** – Data visualization & dashboarding  
- **Excel** – Initial data prep  
- **Word** – Report writing  
- **ChatGPT** – Guidance and explanation support
